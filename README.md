### Inputs
- Immediate walls (R L U D)
- Distance from ghost
- Ghost going towards you?
[ WALL_R WALL_L WALL_U WALL_D | GDIST_1 GDIST_2 GDIST_3 GDIST_4 | GMODE_1 GMODE_2 GMODE_3 GMODE_4 | CLOSESTFOOD_X CLOSESTFOOD_Y | CLOSESTENG_X CLOSESTENG_Y ]

### Fitness Function 
We need to minimize the fitness function = 1/(elapsedTime+score).
